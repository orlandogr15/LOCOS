# LOCOS
Low-Redshift Cluster Optical Survey (LOCOS I and LOCOS II) updated and ready-to-use catalogs.

LOCOS II sample is not yet complete but will be updated in the future.

LOCOS I's A2384 and A2556 were not processed successfully and should be avoided.
LOCOS II's synthetic GalMod faulty counts in star counts and CMDs are reportedly due to a bug and should not be taken into account.

Graphs and statistics for LOCOS I are a product of Orlando Guti√©rrez-Rojo's bachelor thesis. LOCOS II's have yet to be published and are preliminar results.
